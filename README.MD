## Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example to demonstrate how to use Stealthwright for web automation:

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
const Stealthwright = require('stealthwright');

(async () => {
    const browser = await chromium.launch();
    const context = await Stealthwright(browser);
    const page = await context.newPage();
